# My Very First Web Page

Welcome! This is my very first web page!

[My First Project](https://marie-o.github.io/my-first-website/ "Marie's Page")

This site has 3 navigation bars that showcase the tools and programs 
I'm currently studying in my course from Code Institute. The logos will 
automatically direct you to the Wikipedia pages so you can learn more about them.

I have used HTML5 and CSS3 in making this page. In the future, I plan to make 
the site more appealing by aligning the icons; giving them a uniform size;
change the layout and colors.

*Credits goes to my lecturers from Code Institute it is their code that made this 
page possible!*

I hope you'll visit my page again next time. I'm looking forward to adding different 
features as I grow as a developer.
